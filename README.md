## Project Overview
This project involves designing and managing a **relational database** to capture information about **famous people in the movie and music industry**, as well as their contributions. Some individuals, like Rihanna, have excelled in both fields. The project leverages **MySQL** for database design, population, and querying, followed by **Power BI** visualization for insights.

## Steps Involved

### 2. **Populating the Database**
- Insert **at least 10 records per table**, ensuring proper relationships.
- Ensure **data integrity** and normalization.

### 3. **Writing Complex Queries**
- Extract meaningful insights using **SQL queries**.
- Address questions such as the most successful entertainers, award distributions, and revenue trends.

### 4. **Data Export & Power BI Visualization**
- Export relevant tables to **CSV format**.
- Create Power BI dashboards and charts to analyze:
  - **Top 5 most connected famous people**
  - **5 least successful entertainers**
  - **Origin of famous people and regional success of their work**
  - **Award distribution across different categories**
  - **Revenue trends for movies and songs by year**
